# Pac-Man Maze Solver

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project is a Pac-Man-inspired maze solver that visualizes pathfinding algorithms in a randomly generated maze. It demonstrates how **A* Search** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms work in real time.

## 🚀 Features
- Generates a random maze with walls and open paths.
- Implements **A* Search** and **DFS** to find a path from Pac-Man's starting position to the goal.
- Animates Pac-Man’s movement along the solved path.
- Displays the path length for comparison between A* and DFS.
- Allows users to regenerate a new maze dynamically.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** for logic and algorithms.
- **Pygame** for graphical visualization.
- **PriorityQueue & Stack** for pathfinding implementation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Algorithm.py**  Contains A* and DFS implementations.
- **Maze_GUI.py** Handles Pygame rendering and maze generation.
- **Main.py** Runs the game loop and event handling.

## ## 🎮 How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
2. Run the main script
  ```bash
  python Main.py
  ```
## 🎮 Controls
Press A to solve the maze using A Search*.
Press D to solve using DFS.
Press R to regenerate a new maze.
